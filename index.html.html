            <p>Guinea pigs are rodents belonging to the cavy family (Caviidae). They are probably as big as a piglet, but they squeak just like any rodent. 
                Guinea pigs weigh about 500 to 1,500 grams (roughly 1 to 3 pounds) and have a body 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 inches) long. 
                They have robust bodies with short limbs, large head and eyes, short ears, and the feet have hairless soles and short sharp claws.</p>
            <p>Guinea pigs do not originate from Guinea. Instead, they're from a place somewhere in South America. As for its name...¯⁠\⁠⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠⁠/⁠¯</p>

                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Guinea pigs are social creatures. They cannot live long without a friend or else they get too depressed and die.
                Guinea pigs are 'prey' animals, means they startle easily, and when they sense danger either freeze in place for long periods, or run for cover.
                When they are happily excited, they do this thing called 'popcorning'; they basically just hop around.
                Guinea pigs are appearantly good swimmers, though you can't see them swim often because they do not like water and its skin is sensitive to temperature changes. So they only get baths about 2-3 times a year.</p>
                <p>Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion; 
                    which means they can learn tricks like jumping through small obstacles. Take note that they are poor climbers and cannot jump very high. So keep the obstacles easy for them.
                </p>

                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                </header>

                <p>A guinea pig's diet consists of grass hay, such as timothy hay, with a side of food pellets and vegetables. For the younger ones, they are given alfalfa hay mixed with the timothy hay.
                    Once they reach 6 months old, they must cease eating alfalfa hay.
                    Guinea pigs needs to be given vitamin C or else they eventually suffer from scuvy. That can be obtained through vegetables and tablets.
                </p>

                <p>Treats! You can only give them treats about a few times a day. It's also used to teach them tricks. Fruit also works as a treat for them as well as another source of vitamins.</p>

                    <h2>Guinea Pig Language</h2>
                </header>

                    <li>'wheek'= a loud noise that expresses excitement in response to the presence of its owner or when feeding. It's also a noise for assistance in case the guinea pig gets lost.</li>
                    <li>purring= a response to being petted or held and when its enjoying itself.</li>
                    <li>rumbling= a noise to show dominance aswell as a response to being scared or angry.</li>

                    <h2>Living Environment</h2>
                </header>

                <p>Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages. Some guinea pig fanatics give up an entire room for their guinea pigs to live in.
                    In their cages, they obviously need food and water. They also need a litter box (they dont always discard their waste in the box though). 
                    A shelter to hide in and a few tunnels to keep them entertained is great as well. You can let them out of their cages, with fences or without, just make sure they dont hide in the nooks and crannies of your home.
